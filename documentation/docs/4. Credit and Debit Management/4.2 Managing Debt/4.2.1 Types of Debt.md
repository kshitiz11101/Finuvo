**4.2.1 Types of Debt**

Debt is a financial obligation that arises when one party borrows money from another with the promise of repaying the borrowed sum, usually with interest, over a specified period. Understanding the various types of debt is crucial for effective debt management and financial planning.

#### 1. **Secured Debt:**
