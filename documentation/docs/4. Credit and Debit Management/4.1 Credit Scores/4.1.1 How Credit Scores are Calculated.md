**4.1.1 How Credit Scores are Calculated**

Credit scores are numerical representations of an individual's creditworthiness, providing lenders with an assessment of the risk associated with extending credit to that individual. Understanding how credit scores are calculated is essential for individuals seeking to manage and improve their creditworthiness.

#### **Key Factors in Credit Score Calculation:**

1. **Payment History (35%):**
   - *On-Time Payments:*
     - The most significant factor in credit score calculation is an individual's payment history. Lenders assess whether payments on credit accounts (credit cards, loans) are made on time.
     - Consistently making payments by the due date positively impacts the credit score.

2. **Credit Utilization (30%):**
   - *Credit Card Balances:*
     - Credit utilization measures the ratio of credit card balances to credit limits. Keeping credit card balances low relative to credit limits positively influences the credit score.
     - High credit utilization can signal financial stress and may negatively impact the score.

3. **Length of Credit History (15%):**
   - *Credit Account Age:*
     - The length of an individual's credit history is considered. Longer credit histories generally have a positive impact on the credit score.
     - Closing old credit accounts can shorten the credit history, potentially affecting the score.

4. **Types of Credit in Use (10%):**
   - *Credit Mix:*
     - A diverse mix of credit types, such as credit cards, installment loans, and retail accounts, can positively impact the credit score.
     - A balanced mix indicates responsible credit management.

5. **New Credit (10%):**
   - *Recent Inquiries and Accounts:*
     - Opening multiple new credit accounts within a short period can negatively impact the credit score.
     - Credit inquiries related to loan applications are considered, with numerous inquiries seen as a potential risk.

#### **Credit Score Ranges:**

1. **Excellent (800-850):**
   - Individuals with excellent credit scores are likely to qualify for the most favorable interest rates and terms.
   - This range reflects a strong history of on-time payments, low credit utilization, and a lengthy and diverse credit history.

2. **Good (670-799):**
   - A good credit score indicates a solid credit history, though not at the top tier.
   - Individuals with good credit scores are generally considered low credit risks.

3. **Fair (580-669):**
   - A fair credit score suggests some credit challenges, such as occasional late payments or higher credit utilization.
   - Individuals in this range may face higher interest rates and less favorable terms.

4. **Poor (300-579):**
   - Individuals with poor credit scores may have significant credit issues, including a history of missed payments or defaults.
   - Access to credit may be limited, and interest rates can be high.

#### **Monitoring and Improving Credit Scores:**

1. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Individuals are advised to regularly monitor their credit reports for accuracy and potential discrepancies.
   - Checking the credit report helps identify and address any issues that may affect the credit score.

2. **Timely Payments:**
   - Making payments on time is crucial for maintaining and improving credit scores. Setting up reminders or automatic payments can assist in ensuring timely payments.

3. **Credit Utilization Management:**
   - Managing credit card balances and keeping credit utilization low positively impacts the credit score.
   - Paying down high balances and avoiding maxing out credit cards are prudent strategies.

4. **Strategic Use of Credit:**
   - Using credit responsibly and strategically, such as maintaining a mix of credit types, can contribute to a positive credit profile.
   - Opening new credit accounts only when necessary and managing credit inquiries judiciously is advisable.
