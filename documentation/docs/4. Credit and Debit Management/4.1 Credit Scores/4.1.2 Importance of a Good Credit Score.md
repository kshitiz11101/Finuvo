#### **Key Reasons for the Importance of a Good Credit Score:**

1. **Access to Credit:**
   - A good credit score is a key factor that lenders consider when evaluating an individual's creditworthiness. A higher credit score increases the likelihood of approval for credit cards, loans, and mortgages.

   - A good credit score can result in significant savings over the life of loans, reducing the overall cost of borrowing.

3. **Credit Card Approval and Limits:**
   - Credit card issuers assess credit scores to decide whether to approve a credit card application and determine the credit limit.
   - A good credit score increases the likelihood of approval and may lead to higher credit limits, providing greater financial flexibility.
