   - *Entity Structure:*
     - Choose the appropriate business entity structure (e.g., sole proprietorship, LLC, S corporation) to optimize tax benefits.
     - Leverage business deductions and credits available for your specific industry.

6. **Education Planning:**
   - *Education Savings Accounts:*
     - Take advantage of tax-advantaged education savings accounts, such as 529 plans, to save for qualified education expenses with potential tax-free withdrawals.

7. **Healthcare Planning:**
   - *Health Savings Accounts (HSAs):*
     - Maximize contributions to HSAs for tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses.

8. **Charitable Giving:**
